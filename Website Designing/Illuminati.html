	<h2> History </h2>
</center>
	<p> <br> The Illuminati first appeared in the Sentry story arc of New Avengers, written by Brian Michael Bendis. Bendis explored their history in the New Avengers: Illuminati one-shot (May 2006), which built up to the Civil War event that summer. 
		 Bendis, along with co-writer Brian Reed and artist Jim Cheung, produced a five-issue miniseries filling out what the group does behind the scenes between their formation and dissolution. 
		 The first issue of The New Avengers: Illuminati was released in December 2006 and the final issue was released in November 2007.

	<p> Creator Bendis says of the group's members:
	    They each represent a certain something that is very special to the Marvel Universe: </p>
	<ul>
		<li> Namor is a King of the Atlantis and the Seven Oceans and represents the antihero mindset. </li>
		<li> Tony Stark represents the Avenger type of hero, one who understands and appreciates that a hero can work with the government, rather than outside of it. He also represents the common man, as he possesses no natural superhuman abilities. </li>
		<li> Reed Richards: Leader of Fantastic Four. Represents the science-based part of the superhero community. </li>
		<li> Black Bolt: King of Inhumans, who are an important part of Marvel history and play an important part in events that have not yet come to pass. He also represents a ruler/king archetype, one that has also been filled by Namor. </li>
		<li> Doctor Stephen Strange: Sorcerer Supreme of Earth. Speaks for the mystical/non-scientific side of the Marvel universe. </li>
		<li> Professor Charles Xavier: Leader of the X-Men is there on behalf of the mutant community. </li>
	</ul>
