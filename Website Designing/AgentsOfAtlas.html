	<h2> History </h2>
</center>
	<p> <br> This group of heroes, which was not a team in 1950s comics, was established through retroactive continuity as having been formed in the 1950s.
	        They originally appeared as a group in the alternate-universe story What If #9 (June 1978)and then reappeared in Avengers Forever (1998–2000 miniseries), in which they and their reality were destroyed. </br>
	    <br> The limited series Agents of Atlas #1–6 (Oct. 2006 – March 2007) was set in the present day and likewise set in mainstream continuity. The series emerged from what writer Parker called "a huge editorial hunch" at Marvel, and said the revival of the characters "is something that Mark Paniccia was looking at and thought specifically of me, and asked me what I would do with it".
		 Paniccia says the idea came to him when he picked up a copy of the What if? story and found the cover "intriguing" </br>
	    <br> During War of the Realms a new iteration of the Agents of Atlas debuted in the War of the Realms: Agents of Atlas mini-series. This new team, along with the classic roster, was featured together in a new, 5-issue Agents of Atlas limited series. </br>
