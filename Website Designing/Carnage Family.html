	<h2> History </h2>
</center>
	<p>  The Carnage Family came together when Carnage broke free from prison, uniting several other psychopaths to wreak havok with him. The Carnage Family massacred several areas of New York City, killing hundreds of people. 
             They were met by an opposition composing of Spider-Man ,Venom, and several other prominent super heroes. Although demonstrating superior power and skill early on, the Carnage Family was eventually defeated, resulting in the death of the
             Doppelganger and the defeat of all the other members.
