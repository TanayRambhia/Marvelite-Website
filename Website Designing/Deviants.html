	<h2> History </h2>
</center>
	 <b> Creation and Rebellion </b> 
	<p> <br> The Deviants were a race of genetically engineered organic beings, created by the Celestial Arishem the Judge in order to assist in the process of Celestial seeding. Arishem created the Deviant race with an intended role; to wipe out the apex predators of seeded worlds and thus allow sentient life to evolve. 
	         For a time, the Deviants succeeded in this role, killing of the predators of many worlds, starting with the extinction of the dinosaurs.
	    <br> However, the Deviants, due to their biological nature, were not subject to full control from the Celestials, and began to rebel. By killing the predators of worlds, they were able to take the form of their slain prey, and soon took on the role of apex predators themselves. 
	         The Deviants began to ravage the seeded worlds they were intended to protect, wiping out all life on them.

	    <br> Having lost control of the Deviants, who were now running rampant across the galaxy, Arishem created a new race to combat them, synthetic rather than organic, and named them Eternals. 
		 It became the role of the Eternals to exterminate the Deviants and protect seeded worlds, and Eternals soon hunted Deviants across the galaxy.

	<b> Emergence </b> 
	<p> <br> In 2023, due to the Blip, the ice defrosted, and Kro and his pack were set free. They roamed the ice sheets and killed a group of local oil workers. When the Eternal Ikaris discovered them, he brought Ajak, the leader of the team, there and lured her into their path. 
	    The Deviants attacked her, and while she was able to fight a few back with a shotgun, Kro soon killed her, draining her power and taking it for himself. Within his cave, Kro underwent a transformation, and used his tentacles to transform the other members of his pack.
	    <br> Kro later travelled to London, England, attacking the Eternals Sersi and Sprite, but was forced to retreat after the arrival of Ikaris. Kro reconvened with his pack and they later attacked Druigâ€™s compound in Peru, the pack attacking the various Eternals. 
		 In the conflict, Kro killed Gilgamesh and gained sentience after draining his power. Speaking for the first time, he retreated once more. The rest of the Deviant pack were all killed by the Eternals.
	    <br> Left alone, Kro followed the Eternals as they traveled to stop the Emergence. Arriving on the shore, Kro attacked and injured Makkari. He then singled out and fought Thena in a cave, but was ultimately killed by her. With Kro's death, the last Deviant was slain
