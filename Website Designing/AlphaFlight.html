	<h2> History </h2>
</center>
	<p> <br> Created by Canadian writer and artist John Byrne, the team first appeared in a two-part story in The Uncanny X-Men #120 and 121. Byrne never intended the team to be an ongoing title. He created them "merely to survive a fight with the X-Men" for the purposes of that story. 
	    Marvel convinced Byrne to feature them in their own series as a way to capitalize on Byrne's soaring popularity with comics fans at the time, but he never found them to have compelling stories or backgrounds and left the title after writing and pencilling the first 28 issues. 
	    The series continued until 1994, lasting 130 issues as well as annuals and miniseries. 
	    There have been three short-lived revivals since then, most recently an eight-issue limited series in 2011–12, after the resurrection of the team in the one shot comic Chaos War: Alpha Flight during the Chaos War event. </br>
	 <br> Most team members have distinctly Canadian attributes, such as having Inuit/First Nations or French heritage. 
	      Throughout most of its history, the team has worked for Department H, a fictional branch of Canada's Department of National Defence that deals with super-powered villains. </br>
