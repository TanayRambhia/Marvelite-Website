	<h2> History </h2>
</center>
	<p> <br> During the Secret Invasion tie-in issues of Incredible Hercules, Hercules was made the leader of a team of gods to battle the pantheon of Skrull gods, seeking to launch a preemptive strike to prevent the Skrulls from subjugating Earth and thus its culture, society, and religion.
		 This "God Squad" consists of Snowbird, Ajak, Amatsu-Mikaboshi, and Demogorge, and opposes the Skrull gods led by Kly'bn and Sl'gur't, gathered not only by the representatives of the Gods of the North, South, East and West, but of the Elder Gods of Earth.
		 They get to the Skrulls in a boat made from the Rainbow Serpent's skin after stealing a chart from Nightmare using Mikaboshi's deception. However a Skrull agent disguised as Cho's coyote pup Kirby destroys it, but has his head bitten off by Atum. 
		 AlthougC:\Users\user\Desktop\Tanay\Mini Projects\Website Designing\Photos\f05ae44aebe436cb8d8a6ee41d22dac3-comic-art-comic-book.jpgh Ajak and Demogorge are slain by the enemy Skrulls, the team ultimately manages to triumph and destroy the Skrull deities to return to Earth, Kly'bn is impaled on Demogorges spine by Snowbird after Hercules knocks him back, and Sl'gurt is killed by Mikaboshi, when she assumes his form she is torn in two, meaning the rest of the team think Mikaboshi is dead.
		 This happens around the time of Reed Richards' escape at Secret Invasion #5. Mikaboshi stays behind after killing Sl'gur't and takes over the Skrull Pantheon.

	    <br> After Mikaboshi emerges as the primal Chaos King and takes over the thousands of slave-deities of the Skrulls, he leads them to ravage the many worlds and realities of the deities of other extraterrestrial civilizations, such as the gods of the Shi'ar and the gods of Zenn-La, enslaving them all and leeching their power to further bolster himself.
		 Hercules senses Mikaboshi's coming, and to counter him and his hordes, assembles a new version of the God Squad to help fight him in the devastating Chaos War.
		 While the Chaos King scatters the God Squad across Earth and the divine realms, the six of them manage to reunite and aid the surviving gods in the final battle, ultimately managing to stop the threat of Mikaboshi.
